## Description

- Vote on the winner of a hypothetical, randomized animal match-up.

- Utilizes web3.js to connect to Ethereum nodes.

- Currently, the smart contract(s) is/are only deployed to the Kovan Test Network.

- Additionally, the application is configured to connect to a local network with [Ganache](https://www.trufflesuite.com/ganache).

## User Guide

To access the deployed website, you can view it [deployed on Heroku here](https://the-great-animal-combat-sim.herokuapp.com/).

Before accessing the site, make sure you have an Ethereum-wallet extension available in your browser. If you're using Google Chrome, I recommend [installing MetaMask](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/metamask/nkbihfbeogaeaoehlefnkodbefgpgknn?hl=en).



**Placing a vote on the site is very easy!** Once MetaMask is installed, upon deciding on the winner of a given fight, you can initiate a smart contract transaction.
